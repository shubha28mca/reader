Assumptions and Constraints
Appliance is registration is done from portal during the registration.
Appliance make many other dependency calls to other microservices where SRS one of them.

But while delete and reset though there is no "appliance microservice", which ideally should handle this, we are adjusting the design to compensate this in SRS.
Below are some design design diversion we have taken for this
1. Purge should not block for any preflight, because it used for the cleaning up the services. but we are using the purge DRA to validate the appliance health during the appliance is unhealthy.
2. In the purge, of the RCM call failed then purge job will fail. and which is not and recomended design for the purge API.
3. If the SDS calls fail then the purge job will fail.
