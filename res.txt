Question 1

A luxury furniture manufacturer EliteCraft Pvt Ltd receives an order for twenty executive desks. The cost accountant must use job order costing to calculate the total cost and cost per desk. The data provided includes wood and raw materials costing fifty thousand and labor charges costing thirty thousand. Factory overheads are applied at twenty percent of direct labor.

Step one is to determine direct costs. Direct material is fifty thousand. Direct labor is thirty thousand. Step two is to calculate factory overhead. Twenty percent of thirty thousand equals six thousand. Step three is to accumulate the total job cost. Material fifty thousand plus labor thirty thousand plus overhead six thousand gives a total cost of eighty six thousand. Step four is to determine the cost per unit. The total cost of eighty six thousand is divided by the twenty desks. The cost per desk is four thousand three hundred.

Job order costing benefits customized manufacturing because it assigns costs to specific jobs or orders rather than spreading costs evenly across mass production. It tracks direct material direct labor and applied overhead for each individual product or batch. This method improves cost control because managers can see the actual costs incurred for each customer order and compare them with estimates.

It also supports pricing decisions. Since each job has a clear cost record the company can set prices that cover costs and generate profit. It prevents underpricing which can lead to losses and overpricing which can reduce competitiveness. Job order costing improves accountability by making every department responsible for the costs that belong to their part of the process.

Another major benefit is accuracy in overhead allocation. Instead of guessing general overhead percentages job order costing uses predetermined rates based on labor hours machine hours or other allocation bases which keeps cost calculation consistent and reasonable. It is especially useful in custom furniture manufacturing where each job differs in design materials finish and labor time.

Job order costing also creates reliable cost documentation. This helps in future planning and budgeting because the company can compare the actual cost data from previous jobs. It supports continuous improvement since management can identify inefficiencies such as high material waste or excessive labor time on specific types of orders.

Finally job order costing strengthens customer communication. When a corporate client places a special order EliteCraft can provide a transparent cost breakdown which increases trust and enables smoother contract negotiations. For specialized orders such as executive desks with ergonomic design knowing the cost of each component ensures competitive pricing and profitable operations.

In conclusion the total job cost is eighty six thousand and the cost per desk is four thousand three hundred. Job order costing gives EliteCraft accurate cost tracking better pricing decisions effective budgeting and improved operational control in a customized production environment.
