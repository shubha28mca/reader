A luxury furniture manufacturer EliteCraft Pvt Ltd receives an order for twenty executive desks. The cost accountant must use job order costing to calculate the total cost and cost per desk. The data provided includes wood and raw materials costing fifty thousand and labor charges costing thirty thousand. Factory overheads are applied at twenty percent of direct labor.

Step one is to determine direct costs. Direct material is fifty thousand. Direct labor is thirty thousand. Step two is to calculate factory overhead. Twenty percent of thirty thousand equals six thousand. Step three is to accumulate the total job cost. Material fifty thousand plus labor thirty thousand plus overhead six thousand gives a total cost of eighty six thousand. Step four is to determine the cost per unit. The total cost of eighty six thousand is divided by the twenty desks. The cost per desk is four thousand three hundred.

Job order costing benefits customized manufacturing because it assigns costs to specific jobs or orders rather than spreading costs evenly across mass production. It tracks direct material direct labor and applied overhead for each individual product or batch. This method improves cost control because managers can see the actual costs incurred for each customer order and compare them with estimates.

It also supports pricing decisions. Since each job has a clear cost record the company can set prices that cover costs and generate profit. It prevents underpricing which can lead to losses and overpricing which can reduce competitiveness. Job order costing improves accountability by making every department responsible for the costs that belong to their part of the process.

Another major benefit is accuracy in overhead allocation. Instead of guessing general overhead percentages job order costing uses predetermined rates based on labor hours machine hours or other allocation bases which keeps cost calculation consistent and reasonable. It is especially useful in custom furniture manufacturing where each job differs in design materials finish and labor time.

Job order costing also creates reliable cost documentation. This helps in future planning and budgeting because the company can compare the actual cost data from previous jobs. It supports continuous improvement since management can identify inefficiencies such as high material waste or excessive labor time on specific types of orders.

Finally job order costing strengthens customer communication. When a corporate client places a special order EliteCraft can provide a transparent cost breakdown which increases trust and enables smoother contract negotiations. For specialized orders such as executive desks with ergonomic design knowing the cost of each component ensures competitive pricing and profitable operations.

In conclusion the total job cost is eighty six thousand and the cost per desk is four thousand three hundred. Job order costing gives EliteCraft accurate cost tracking better pricing decisions effective budgeting and improved operational control in a customized production environment.

Question 2

A company with an average workforce of seven hundred fifty recruited two hundred new employees and had one hundred fifty separations. Labour turnover ratios help measure how often employees leave or join an organisation in a period. The common turnover ratios are separation rate replacement rate and flux rate.

The separation rate measures the percentage of employees who left the organisation. It is calculated as separations divided by average workforce multiplied by one hundred. One hundred fifty divided by seven hundred fifty multiplied by one hundred equals twenty percent. That means twenty percent of the workforce left the company due to dissatisfaction.

The replacement rate measures the percentage of new employees hired to replace those who left. It follows the same formula using recruits instead of separations. Two hundred divided by seven hundred fifty multiplied by one hundred equals twenty six point seven percent. This means the company recruited more workers than required just to maintain staff levels which is costly.

The flux rate combines both separations and recruitment to provide an overall labour movement indicator. It is calculated by adding separations and recruits divided by the average workforce multiplied by one hundred. Three hundred fifty divided by seven hundred fifty multiplied by one hundred equals forty six point seven percent. A flux rate of nearly fifty percent is extremely high and indicates instability in the workforce.

High turnover damages productivity morale and training costs. The company should introduce clear strategies to reduce attrition. First it must improve working conditions by identifying major dissatisfaction factors through surveys exit interviews and feedback sessions. Second it should introduce fair compensation policies including competitive salaries benefits and bonus structures to reduce poaching by competitors.

Third the organisation must invest in employee engagement. Recognition programs skill development career growth paths and transparent promotion systems help employees feel valued. Fourth it should improve management practices because poor supervisors are one of the most common reasons for resignations. Training leaders in communication conflict handling and motivation will make a noticeable difference in retention.

Fifth flexible work options such as hybrid schedules shift adjustments or wellness programs can improve satisfaction and reduce stress. Sixth building a positive organisational culture based on respect fairness and open communication will reduce turnover dramatically.

The company should also implement structured onboarding and mentoring for new employees. Proper orientation reduces early resignations. Finally measuring labour turnover regularly is essential. Monthly or quarterly analysis will help identify trends before they become major issues.

In conclusion the separation rate is twenty percent the replacement rate is twenty six point seven percent and the flux rate is forty six point seven percent. These values clearly show a serious turnover issue driven by workplace dissatisfaction. By improving working conditions strengthening rewards and developing leadership practices the company can lower turnover costs and improve workforce stability.

Alpha Textiles is struggling with high production costs and frequent cost overruns because of weak cost control unpredictable markets and limited skilled staff. Standard costing can bring discipline but only if implemented carefully with clear responsibility and practical processes.

The first step is defining realistic standards. Alpha Textiles should start with basic cost components material labor and overhead. Set attainable standards based on historical data supplier quotations and industry benchmarks. Avoid ideal standards because they will demotivate workers and cause constant unfavorable variances. Use flexible standards that can be reviewed quarterly to match market price movements especially for cotton dyes and chemicals which are volatile.

Next establish a small cross functional costing team. Since skilled manpower is limited combine internal staff from production finance and store management with a part time external consultant. The consultant trains the team sets formats and guides variance analysis for the first six months. This reduces skill shortages without long term cost burden.

Develop a simple variance reporting system. Each department must know what it is responsible for. Material price variance should be assigned to the purchase department. Material usage variance should go to the production supervisor. Labor efficiency variance belongs to the production line manager. Overhead variances should be reviewed by finance and plant heads together. This clear allocation prevents blame shifting and ensures accountability.

To deal with unpredictable markets introduce rolling standards. Instead of annual standards update the material standard prices every quarter. For labor and overhead keep yearly standards but perform monthly variance tracking. This approach limits market risk without creating frequent disruption.

Invest in training but keep it practical. Conduct weekly short training sessions on how to read cost reports how to interpret variances and how to take corrective action. Give managers templates and dashboards instead of long theory manuals. Use simple tools like spreadsheets before moving to costly ERP systems.

Implement a pilot phase. Start standard costing on one product line for three months. Review results identify challenges and improve procedures before full scale implementation. A pilot avoids chaos and builds confidence.

For innovation use automation where possible. Barcode based material issue tracking digital attendance for labor time recording and simple cost dashboards reduce errors. Use basic cloud software instead of expensive systems. Partner with suppliers for fixed quarterly pricing contracts to stabilize material standards.

Finally integrate performance incentives. Link supervisors bonuses with reduction in unfavorable variances especially material wastage and labor inefficiency. This drives ownership and continuous improvement.

In summary standard costing will help Alpha Textiles control costs reduce overruns and improve planning but only if it is rolled out step by step with realistic standards clear responsibility simple reporting systems periodic revisions and practical training. This approach removes skill barriers reduces market uncertainty and ensures measurable results.
